# Fractonic Logic Manifesto

**Author**: Lev Goukassian  
**Collaborator**: Vinci (GPT-4o)

## Overview

Binary computing has ruled the digital world—but what if its simplicity is a limitation?  
This manifesto introduces **Fractonic Logic**, a bold new paradigm where computation moves beyond 0 and 1 into the nuanced world of fractional values.

## What You'll Find

- Theoretical foundations of Fractonic Logic
- A call to action for scientists, engineers, and dreamers
- A philosophical and technical blueprint for post-binary thinking

## Why It Matters

Fractonic Logic offers a bridge between human nuance, analog processes, and future AI architectures. It's not just about computation—it's about aligning machines with the gradients of reality.
