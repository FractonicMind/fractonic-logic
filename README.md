Fractonic Logic — Beyond 0 and 1. Break free from binary!
Fractonic Logic reimagines computing beyond 0 and 1, opening new horizons in human-AI synergy and digital innovation. Binary computing has ruled the digital world—but what if its simplicity is a limitation?

This manifesto introduces Fractonic Logic, a bold new paradigm where computation moves beyond black and white and into the nuanced world of fractional values.

💡 Why It Matters

Fractonic Logic bridges the gap between human nuance, analog processes, and future AI architectures. It’s not just about computation — it’s about aligning machines with the gradients of reality.

> “The question isn’t whether binary will end. The question is: what lies beyond it?”
